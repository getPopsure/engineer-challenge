# Feather Take Home Assessment

Thank you for applying at Feather and taking the time to do this home assessment.

The goal of this project is to let you show off your coding and problem-solving skills, on a task that resembles the kind of work you’ll be doing with us.

Depending on the position you are applying, you can focus more on the frontend or backend part of the application (or both if you are applying for a fullstack position).

You can spend as little or as much time as you like on this project. We've generated some boilerplate for you to get started.

1. Start by reading the [User story](#User-story) and the [Acceptance criteria](#Acceptance-criteria) to have a clear idea of the requirements.
2. Use the [Getting started](#Getting-started) guide to set up a local version of the project on your machine.
3. Take a look at the [Data structure](#Data-structure) and [API](#API) to know what the data looks like.
4. Finish by answering a [couple of questions](#General-questions) about the project. You can answer them on this very same file.

## User story

As a user, I want to be able to search for policies using any of the text fields displayed on the table.

When a search filter is applied, I want to see the filtered information on the same table.

When a search filter is applied, I want to be able to clear the current search filter, this action will display the original information.

## Acceptance criteria

- Show only `ACTIVE` and `PENDING` policies.
- Do not display any results if there are no matches
- Clearing the search should return the table to its original state

## Task requirements

- Make sure your feature **works as expected**
- Your code is **easy to understand** and follows best practices
- The project **runs with one command,** and without any external configuration
- **Your code has tests** to make sure the functionalities work as expected

## Getting started

1. Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed on your machine
2. Set up the environment variables

```bash
cp ./backend/.env.example ./backend/.env
```

3. Build and run the Docker image:

```bash
cd backend
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

4. On a new terminal, run the migration and the seed script to add initial data:

```bash
docker compose exec backend yarn prisma migrate dev
docker compose exec backend yarn prisma db seed
```

5. That’s it!

You can see the app on `http://localhost:3000`

The API should be running on `http://localhost:4000`

** Note **
If you want to install new dependencies, you'll have to do it inside the docker container. To do that, you can use the following command:

```
docker compose exec {backend OR frontend} yarn add {the_name_of_the_package}
```

Make sure to replace the values between the curly braces `{}` with the correct ones.

## API

After following the [Getting started](#Getting-started) guide, the backend should be running on port `4000`. The backend currently have one endpoint:

| Request type | Path        | Query Params | Example                   |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------ | ------------------------- |
| `GET`        | `/policies` | `search`     | `/policies?search=BARMER` |

Feel free to update or add more endpoints to accommodate or improve your solution.

| ----------- | ------ | ----------------------------- |

What’s the part of the solution you are most proud of?

- Frontend test cases on search functionality including server mock

If you had more time, what other things you would like to do?

- Paginate results on both BE and FE
- Write more rigorous tests and more test coverage
  - Error handling on both BE and FE
  - BE route and controller
- Explore prisma [fullTextSearch](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/full-text-search) for potentially one-for-all search filter solution
- Add request param for status (`/policies?status=pending,active`)
- Fix mobile navbar UI

Is there anything you would like to change in the current setup?

- Seems like `${DATABASE_PORT}` of db ports in `docker-compose.yaml` needs to be fixed. My setup got blocked by this issue. (I replaced it with plain number in my code.)
