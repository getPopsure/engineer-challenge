# Feather Take Home Assessment

Thank you for applying at Feather and taking the time to do this home assessment.

The goal of this project is to let you **show off your coding and problem-solving skills**, on a task that resembles the kind of work you’ll be doing with us.

This coding challenge applies to **frontend, backend, and full-stack roles**. Depending on the position you are applying for, you can focus on your specific area.

You can spend as little or as much time as you like on this project. We've added some initial boilerplate to help you get started, but **feel free to refactor every part of this app as you may seem fit**.

1. Start by reading the [Engineering challenge](#Engineering-challenge) for the position you've applied for and don't forget about the **Acceptance criteria** to have a clear idea of the requirements.
2. Use the [Getting started](#Getting-started) guide to set up a local version of the project on your machine.
3. Take a look at the [Data structure](#Data-structure) and [API](#API) to know what the data looks like.
4. Finish by answering a [couple of questions](#General-questions) about the project. You can answer them on this very same file.

## Engineering challenge

We've prepared several different user stories to work on. Depending on what position you applied to, pick one of them:

- [Backend](./backend-readme.md)
- [Frontend](./frontend-readme.md)
- [Full Stack](./full-stack-readme.md)

## Task requirements

- Make sure your feature **works as expected**
- Your code is **easy to understand** and follows best practices
- The project **runs with one command,** and without any external configuration
- **Your code has tests** to make sure the functionalities work as expected

## Getting started

1. Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed on your machine
2. Set up the environment variables

```bash
cp ./backend/.env.example ./backend/.env
```

3. Build and run the Docker image:

```bash
cd backend
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

4. On a new terminal, run the migration and the seed script to add initial data:

```bash
cd backend
docker compose exec backend yarn prisma migrate dev
docker compose exec backend yarn prisma db seed
```

5. That’s it!

You can see the app on `http://localhost:3000`

The API should be running on `http://localhost:4000`

** Note **
If you want to install new dependencies, you'll have to do it inside the docker container. To do that, you can use the following command:

```
docker compose exec {backend OR frontend} yarn add {the_name_of_the_package}
```

Make sure to replace the values between the curly braces `{}` with the correct ones.

## API

After following the [Getting started](#Getting-started) guide, the backend should be running on port `4000`. The backend currently have one endpoint:

| Request type | Path        | Query Params | Example                   |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------ | ------------------------- |
| `GET`        | `/policies` | `search`     | `/policies?search=BARMER` |

Feel free to update or add more endpoints to accommodate or improve your solution.

## General questions

- How much time did you spend working on the solution?
  It took me 4 days
- What’s the part of the solution you are most proud of?
  Establishing the correct relative relationship using Prisma and working with filters with its types

- If you had more time, what other things you would like to do?
  A fully responsive view

- Do you have any feedback regarding this coding challenge?
  Initially, I got confused with the relatives/family members table.

  Maybe it would have been helpful to get a little bit more insights on the family members table.

  I would like to thank you for the task, it pushed me to read the prisma documentation
