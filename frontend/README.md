# Frontend

This is the frontend part of the [Feather Software Engineer code challenge](../Readme.md).

This project has been set up with:

- [Create react app](https://create-react-app.dev)
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)

## Getting started

The easiest way to get started is [using Docker](../Readme.md#Getting-started). If you prefer not to use Docker, you can follow the next steps.

Install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

And run the development server:

```bash
yarn start
```

You're all set! The app should now run in [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
